English – Appendix 1: Spelling

English Appendix 1: Spelling
Most people read words more accurately than they spell them. The younger pupils are, the
truer this is.
By the end of year 1, pupils should be able to read a large number of different words
containing the GPCs that they have learnt, whether or not they have seen these words
before. Spelling, however, is a very different matter. Once pupils have learnt more than
one way of spelling particular sounds, choosing the right letter or letters depends on their
either having made a conscious effort to learn the words or having absorbed them less
consciously through their reading. Younger pupils have not had enough time to learn or
absorb the accurate spelling of all the words that they may want to write.
This appendix provides examples of words embodying each pattern which is taught. Many
of the words listed as 'example words' for years 1 and 2, including almost all those listed
as 'exception words', are used frequently in pupils' writing, and therefore it is worth pupils
learning the correct spelling. The 'exception words' contain GPCs which have not yet been
taught as widely applicable, but this may be because they are applicable in very few ageappropriate words rather than because they are rare in English words in general.
The word-lists for years 3 and 4 and years 5 and 6 are statutory. The lists are a mixture of
words pupils frequently use in their writing and those which they often misspell. Some of
the listed words may be thought of as quite challenging, but the 100 words in each list can
easily be taught within the four years of key stage 2 alongside other words that teachers
consider appropriate.
The rules and guidance are intended to support the teaching of spelling. Phonic knowledge
should continue to underpin spelling after key stage 1; teachers should still draw pupils'
attention to GPCs that do and do not fit in with what has been taught so far. Increasingly,
however, pupils also need to understand the role of morphology and etymology. Although
particular GPCs in root words simply have to be learnt, teachers can help pupils to
understand relationships between meaning and spelling where these are relevant. For
example, understanding the relationship between medical and medicine may help pupils to
spell the /s/ sound in medicine with the letter 'c'. Pupils can also be helped to spell words
with prefixes and suffixes correctly if they understand some general principles for adding
them. Teachers should be familiar with what pupils have been taught about spelling in
earlier years, such as which rules pupils have been taught for adding prefixes and suffixes.
In this spelling appendix, the left-hand column is statutory; the middle and righthand columns are non-statutory guidance.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used to represent sounds (phonemes).
A table showing the IPA is provided in this document.

English – Appendix 1: Spelling

Spelling – work for year 1
Revision of reception work
Statutory requirements
The boundary between revision of work covered in Reception and the introduction of
new work may vary according to the programme used, but basic revision should include:


all letters of the alphabet and the sounds which they most commonly represent



consonant digraphs which have been taught and the sounds which they represent



vowel digraphs which have been taught and the sounds which they represent



the process of segmenting spoken words into sounds before choosing graphemes to
represent the sounds



words with adjacent consonants



guidance and rules which have been taught

Statutory
requirements

Rules and guidance (non-statutory)

Example words
(non-statutory)

The sounds /f/, /l/,
/s/, /z/ and /k/ spelt
ff, ll, ss, zz and ck

The /f/, /l/, /s/, /z/ and /k/ sounds are
usually spelt as ff, ll, ss, zz and ck if
they come straight after a single vowel
letter in short words. Exceptions: if,
pal, us, bus, yes.

off, well, miss, buzz,
back

The /ŋ/ sound spelt
n before k
Division of words

bank, think, honk,
sunk
Each syllable is like a 'beat' in the
spoken word. Words of more than one
syllable often have an unstressed
syllable in which the vowel sound is
unclear.

pocket, rabbit, carrot,
thunder, sunset

Rules and guidance (non-statutory)

-tch

The /tʃ/ sound is usually spelt as tch if it catch, fetch, kitchen,
notch, hutch
comes straight after a single vowel
letter. Exceptions: rich, which, much,
such.

The /v/ sound at the
end of words

English words hardly ever end with the
letter v, so if a word ends with a /v/
sound, the letter e usually needs to be
added after the 'v'.

have, live, give

Adding s and es to
words (plural of
nouns and the third
person singular of
verbs)

If the ending sounds like /s/ or /z/, it is
spelt as –s. If the ending sounds like
/ɪz/ and forms an extra syllable or 'beat'
in the word, it is spelt as –es.

cats, dogs, spends,
rocks, thanks,
catches

Adding the endings
–ing, –ed and –er to
verbs where no
change is needed
to the root word

–ing and –er always add an extra
syllable to the word and –ed sometimes
does.

hunting, hunted,
hunter, buzzing,
buzzed, buzzer,
jumping, jumped,
jumper

Adding –er and –est
to adjectives where
no change is
needed to the root
word

As with verbs (see above), if the
adjective ends in two consonant letters
(the same or different), the ending is
simply added on.

The past tense of some verbs may
sound as if it ends in /ɪd/ (extra
syllable), /d/ or /t/ (no extra syllable),
but all these endings are spelt –ed.
If the verb ends in two consonant letters
(the same or different), the ending is
simply added on.

Example words
(non-statutory)

grander, grandest,
fresher, freshest,
quicker, quickest

Rules and guidance
(non-statutory)

The /dʒ/ sound spelt
as ge and dge at the
end of words, and
sometimes spelt as g
elsewhere in words
before e, i and y

The letter j is never used for the /dʒ/
sound at the end of English words.

Example words
(non-statutory)

At the end of a word, the /dʒ/ sound
is spelt –dge straight after the /æ/,
/ɛ/, /ɪ/, /ɒ/, /ʌ/ and /ʊ/ sounds
(sometimes called 'short' vowels).

badge, edge, bridge,
dodge, fudge

After all other sounds, whether
vowels or consonants, the /dʒ/ sound
is spelt as –ge at the end of a word.

age, huge, change,
charge, bulge, village

In other positions in words, the /dʒ/
sound is often (but not always) spelt
as g before e, i, and y. The /dʒ/
sound is always spelt as j before a, o
and u.

gem, giant, magic,
giraffe, energy
jacket, jar, jog, join,
adjust

The /s/ sound spelt c
before e, i and y

race, ice, cell, city,

The /n/ sound spelt
kn and (less often) gn
at the beginning of
words

The 'k' and 'g' at the beginning of
these words was sounded hundreds
of years ago.

knock, know, knee,
gnat, gnaw

The /r/ sound spelt wr
at the beginning of
words

This spelling probably also reflects
an old pronunciation.

write, written, wrote,
wrong, wrap

The /l/ or /əl/ sound
spelt –le at the end of

The –le spelling is the most common
spelling for this sound at the end of
words.

(non-statutory)

The /l/ or /əl/ sound
spelt –el at the end of
words

The –el spelling is much less
common than –le.

camel, tunnel, squirrel,
travel, towel, tinsel

The –el spelling is used after m, n,
r, s, v, w and more often than not
after s.

The /l/ or /əl/ sound
spelt –al at the end of
words

Not many nouns end in –al, but
many adjectives do.

metal, pedal, capital,
hospital, animal

Words ending –il

There are not many of these words.

pencil, fossil, nostril

The /aɪ/ sound spelt
–y at the end of
words

This is by far the most common
spelling for this sound at the end of
words.

cry, fly, dry, try, reply,
July

Adding –es to nouns
and verbs ending in
–y

The y is changed to i before –es is
added.

flies, tries, replies,
copies, babies, carries

Adding –ed, –ing, –er
and –est to a root
word ending in –y
with a consonant
before it

The y is changed to i before –ed, –er
and –est are added, but not before –
ing as this would result in ii. The
only ordinary words with ii are skiing
and taxiing.

copied, copier,
happier, happiest,
cried, replied

Adding the endings –
ing, –ed, –er, –est
and –y to words
ending in –e with a
consonant before it

The –e at the end of the root word is hiking, hiked, hiker,
dropped before –ing, –ed, –er,
–est, –y or any other suffix beginning
with a vowel letter is added.
Exception: being.

Adding –ing, –ed,
–er, –est and –y to
words of one syllable
ending in a single
consonant letter after
a single vowel letter

The last consonant letter of the root
word is doubled to keep the /æ/, /ɛ/,
/ɪ/, /ɒ/ and /ʌ/ sound (i.e. to keep the
vowel 'short').

The /ɔ:/ sound spelt a
before l and ll

The /ɔ:/ sound (or) is usually spelt
as a before l and ll.

The /ʌ/ sound spelt o

If the last syllable of a word is
stressed and ends with one
consonant letter which has just one
vowel letter before it, the final
consonant letter is doubled before
any ending beginning with a vowel
letter is added. The consonant letter
is not doubled if the syllable is
unstressed.

These words should be learnt as
needed.

young, touch, double,
trouble, country

More prefixes

Most prefixes are added to the
beginning of root words without any
changes in spelling, but see in–
below.
Like un–, the prefixes dis– and mis–
have negative meanings.

dis–: disappoint,
disagree, disobey
mis–: misbehave,
mislead, misspell (mis

The suffix –ation

The suffix –ation is added to verbs
to form nouns. The rules already

The suffix –ly

The suffix –ly is added to an
adjective to form an adverb. The
rules already learnt still apply.

12

sadly, completely,
usually (usual + ly),
finally (final + ly),
The suffix –ly starts with a consonant comically (comical
+ ly)
letter, so it is added straight on to
most root words.

Exceptions:
(1) If the root word ends in –y with a
consonant letter before it, the y is
changed to i, but only if the root word
has more than one syllable.

happily, angrily

(2) If the root word ends with –le, the
–le is changed to –ly.

gently, simply, humbly,
nobly

(3) If the root word ends with –ic,
–ally is added rather than just –ly,
except in the word publicly.

basically, frantically,
dramatically

(4) The words truly, duly, wholly.
Words with endings
sounding like /ʒə/ or
/tʃə/

The ending sounding like /ʒə/ is
always spelt –sure.

measure, treasure,
pleasure, enclosure

The ending sounding like /tʃə/ is
often spelt –ture, but check that the
word is not a root word ending in
(t)ch with an er ending – e.g.
teacher, catcher, richer, stretcher.

creature, furniture,
picture, nature,
adventure

Endings which sound
like /ʒən/

If the ending sounds like /ʒən/, it is
spelt as –sion.

division, invasion,
confusion, decision,
collision, television

The suffix –ous

Sometimes the root word is obvious
and the usual rules apply for adding
suffixes beginning with vowel letters.

poisonous, dangerous,
mountainous, famous,
various

Sometimes there is no obvious root
word.

tremendous,
enormous, jealous

–our is changed to –or before –ous
is added.

humorous, glamorous,
vigorous

A final 'e' of the root word must be
kept if the /dʒ/ sound of 'g' is to be
kept.
If there is an /i:/ sound before the
–ous ending, it is usually spelt as i,
but a few words have e.

courageous,
outrageous
serious, obvious,
curious
hideous, spontaneous,
courteous

Notes and guidance (non-statutory)
Teachers should continue to emphasise to pupils the relationships between sounds and
letters, even when the relationships are unusual. Once root words are learnt in this way,
longer words can be spelt correctly, if the rules and guidance for adding prefixes and
suffixes are also known.

16

English – Appendix 1: Spelling

Notes and guidance (non-statutory)
Examples:
business: once busy is learnt, with due attention to the unusual spelling of the /i/ sound
as 'u', business can then be spelt as busy + ness, with the y of busy changed to i
according to the rule.
disappear: the root word appear contains sounds which can be spelt in more than one
way so it needs to be learnt, but the prefix dis– is then simply added to appear.
Understanding the relationships between words can also help with spelling. Examples:


bicycle is cycle (from the Greek for wheel) with bi– (meaning 'two') before it.



medicine is related to medical so the /s/ sound is spelt as c.



opposite is related to oppose, so the schwa sound in opposite is spelt as o.

–tious

Not many common words end like this.

vicious, precious,
conscious, delicious,
malicious, suspicious

Endings which
sound like /ʃəl/

If the root word ends in –ce, the /ʃ/
sound is usually spelt as c – e.g. vice – vicious, grace – gracious, space –
spacious, malice – malicious.
Exception: anxious.

ambitious, cautious,
fictitious, infectious,
nutritious

–cial is common after a vowel letter
and –tial after a consonant letter, but
there are some exceptions.

official, special, artificial,
partial, confidential,
essential

Exceptions: initial, financial,
commercial, provincial (the spelling of
the last three is clearly related to
finance, commerce and province).
Words ending
in –ant,
–ance/–ancy,
–ent,
–ence/–ency

18

Use –ant and –ance/–ancy if there is
a related word with a /æ/ or /eɪ/ sound
in the right position; –ation endings
are often a clue.

observant, observance,
(observation), expectant
(expectation), hesitant,
hesitancy (hesitation),
tolerant, tolerance
(toleration), substance
(substantial)

Use –ent and –ence/–ency after soft
c (/s/ sound), soft g (/dʒ/ sound) and
qu, or if there is a related word with a
clear /ɛ/ sound in the right position.

innocent, innocence,
decent, decency, frequent,
frequency, confident,
confidence (confidential)

There are many words, however,
where the above guidance does not
help. These words just have to be
learnt.

assistant, assistance,
obedient, obedience,
independent,
independence

Words ending

The –able/–ably endings are far more
common than the –ible/–ibly endings.

Adding suffixes
beginning with
vowel letters to
words ending
in –fer
Use of the
hyphen

As with –ant and –ance/–ancy, the –
applicable/applicably
able ending is used if there is a related (application),
word ending in –ation.
considerable/considerably
(consideration),
tolerable/tolerably
(toleration)
If the –able ending is added to a word
ending in –ce or –ge, the e after the c
or g must be kept as those letters
would otherwise have their 'hard'
sounds (as in cap and gap) before the
a of the –able ending.

changeable, noticeable,
forcible, legible

The –able ending is usually but not
always used if a complete root word
can be heard before it, even if there is
no related word ending in –ation.
The first five examples opposite are
obvious; in reliable, the complete word
rely is heard, but the y changes to i in
accordance with the rule.

dependable, comfortable,
understandable,
reasonable, enjoyable,
reliable

The –ible ending is common if a
complete root word can't be heard
before it but it also sometimes occurs
when a complete word can be heard
(e.g. sensible).

possible/possibly,
horrible/horribly,
terrible/terribly,
visible/visibly,
incredible/incredibly,
sensible/sensibly

The r is doubled if the –fer is still
stressed when the ending is added.

referring, referred, referral,
preferring, preferred,
transferring, transferred

The r is not doubled if the –fer is no
longer stressed.

reference, referee,
preference, transference

Hyphens can be used to join a prefix
to a root word, especially if the prefix
ends in a vowel letter and the root
word also begins with one.

co-ordinate, re-enter,
co-operate, co-own

Notes and guidance (non-statutory)
Teachers should continue to emphasise to pupils the relationships between sounds and
letters, even when the relationships are unusual. Once root words are learnt in this way,
longer words can be spelt correctly if the rules and guidance for adding prefixes and
suffixes are also known. Many of the words in the list above can be used for practice in
adding suffixes.
Understanding the history of words and relationships between them can also help with
spelling.
Examples:


Conscience and conscious are related to science: conscience is simply science with
the prefix con- added. These words come from the Latin word scio meaning I know.



The word desperate, meaning 'without hope', is often pronounced in English
as desp'rate, but the –sper- part comes from the Latin spero, meaning 'I hope', in
which the e was clearly sounded.



Familiar is related to family, so the /ə/ sound in the first syllable of familiar is spelt
as a.
