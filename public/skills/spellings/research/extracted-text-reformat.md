## Introduction

Most people read words more accurately than they spell them. The younger pupils are, the truer this is.

By the end of Year 1, pupils should be able to read a large number of different words containing the GPCs (grapheme-phoneme correspondences) that they have learnt, whether or not they have seen these words before. Spelling, however, is a very different matter. Once pupils have learnt more than one way of spelling particular sounds, choosing the right letter or letters depends on their either having made a conscious effort to learn the words or having absorbed them less consciously through their reading.

This guide provides examples of words embodying each pattern which is taught:
- The word-lists for Years 3-4 and Years 5-6 are statutory
- The lists are a mixture of words pupils frequently use in their writing and those which they often misspell
- Phonic knowledge should continue to underpin spelling after Key Stage 1

## Spelling Work for Year 1

### Revision of Reception Work

**The boundary between revision of work covered in Reception and the introduction of new work may vary according to the programme used, but basic revision should include:**

- All letters of the alphabet and the sounds which they most commonly represent
- Consonant digraphs which have been taught and the sounds which they represent
- Vowel digraphs which have been taught and the sounds which they represent
- The process of segmenting spoken words into sounds before choosing graphemes to represent the sounds
- Words with adjacent consonants
- Guidance and rules which have been taught

### Key Spelling Patterns for Year 1

| Spelling Pattern | Rules and Guidance | Example Words |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| The sounds /f/, /l/, /s/, /z/ and /k/ spelt ff, ll, ss, zz and ck | Usually used if they come straight after a single vowel letter in short words | off, well, miss, buzz, back |
| The /ŋ/ sound spelt n before k | | bank, think, honk, sunk |
| Division of words into syllables | Each syllable is like a 'beat' in the spoken word | pocket, rabbit, carrot, thunder, sunset |
| -tch | The /tʃ/ sound is usually spelt as tch if it comes straight after a single vowel letter | catch, fetch, kitchen, notch, hutch |
| The /v/ sound at the end of words | English words hardly ever end with the letter v, so if a word ends with a /v/ sound, the letter e usually needs to be added after the 'v' | have, live, give |
| Adding s and es to words | If the ending sounds like /s/ or /z/, it is spelt as –s. If it sounds like /ɪz/ and forms an extra syllable, it is spelt as –es | cats, dogs, spends, rocks, thanks, catches |
| Adding -ing, -ed and -er to verbs | -ing and -er always add an extra syllable to the word and -ed sometimes does | hunting, hunted, hunter, buzzing, buzzed, jumper |
| Adding -er and -est to adjectives | If the adjective ends in two consonant letters, the ending is simply added on | grander, grandest, fresher, freshest, quicker, quickest |

| New consonant spellings ph and wh | The /f/ sound is not usually spelt as ph in short everyday words | dolphin, alphabet, phonics, elephant, when, where, which, wheel, while |
